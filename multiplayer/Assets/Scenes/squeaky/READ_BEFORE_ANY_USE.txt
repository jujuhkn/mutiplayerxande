-----------------------

Squeaky is a playful display font with a soft, bouncy rhythm and a friendly tone.

Its rounded shapes and slightly uneven flow give the lettering a lively personality, as if each character was gently squeezed into place. The strokes are thick and confident, but never stiff, keeping the overall feeling lighthearted and expressive. With multiple weights, styles, and decorative variants, the font can shift from simple and charming to bold and energetic without losing its character.

Squeaky feels at home in joyful, imaginative settings. It brings warmth to words and a sense of fun to messages, making text feel approachable and full of movement rather than static.

The font is built with advanced OpenType functionality and guaranteed top-notch quality, containing stylistic and contextual alternates, ligatures and more automatic and manual features; all to give you full control and customizability. 
It has extensive lingual support, covering all Latin-based languages, from North Europa to South Africa, from America to South-East Asia. It contains all characters and symbols you'll ever need, including all punctuation and numbers. 

Designed by Måns Grebäck, Squeaky is drawn with care for both detail and spontaneity, balancing clean construction with a hand-made feel that keeps the font playful and human.
